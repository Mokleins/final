Tittle: Organize the playlist by popularity and least popular 

We target all the browers, and we also did a responsive website so everyone is able to interact with the website.

This project uses the API from spotify, and we take the most popular playlist which we selected Rock, Pop, Hip-hop and Latin Music. The website is going to categorize the app between the most popular, and the least popular song of the play list. Also, we can organize the playlist by name.

We used Spotify API

What visualisations does your project drive?
We used Chart.js 

What visualisation or other JS libraries does your project use?
We used react from the JS libraries.

What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?


What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
We are trying to display the most popular and the least popular. We also sort by name the playist and each album.
